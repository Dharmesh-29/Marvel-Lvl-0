# L293D MOTOR DRIVER
The L293D Motor Driver is a widely used IC for driving DC motors, stepper motors, and other inductive loads. It is part of the L293 family, designed to interface low-level control logic with higher power motors or actuators.
### Key Features of L293D:

* **Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver**: The L293D contains two H-Bridge circuits, allowing it to drive two motors simultaneously. Each H-Bridge can drive a motor forward, backward, or stop, making the IC versatile for controlling the direction and speed of motors.

* **Voltage Supply Range**: The L293D can operate with a voltage supply from 4.5V to 36V for motors, and 4.5V to 5.5V for the logic.

* **Current Rating**: It can supply up to 600mA of continuous current per channel, with a peak current of 1.2A.

* **Built-in Protection**: It includes internal diodes for back EMF protection, which helps in handling inductive loads and preventing damage to the IC.

* **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Control**: PWM is used to control the speed of the motors. By varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the average voltage applied to the motor is adjusted, thus controlling its speed.

### ICs Used in L293D:

The L293D uses various internal transistors, diodes, and resistors to create the H-Bridge circuit that allows for precise control of motor direction and speed. The H-Bridge consists of four transistors arranged in a bridge configuration, which allows current to flow in different directions through the motor, controlling its rotation direction.

### H-Bridge:
An H-Bridge is a circuit configuration of four switches (typically transistors) arranged in a "H" shape. The two diagonals of the H-Bridge are controlled to allow current to flow in either direction through the motor, thereby controlling the motor's rotation direction. By switching the transistors in the right sequence, the motor can be rotated clockwise, counterclockwise, or kept stationary.

### Working of L293D:

* **Motor Direction Control :** The L293D has input pins (IN1, IN2 for motor 1 and IN3, IN4 for motor 2) that control the direction of the motors. Changing the logic level (HIGH or LOW) on these pins determines whether the motor moves forward or backward.

* **Speed Control with PWM :**  By applying a PWM signal to the Enable pins (ENA for motor 1 and ENB for motor 2), the speed of the motor can be controlled. A higher duty cycle results in higher average voltage and thus a faster motor speed.

* **Protection Features :** The L293D has thermal shutdown and overload protection. If the IC gets too hot or is overloaded, it shuts down to prevent damage.
